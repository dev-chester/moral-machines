Welcome to Moral Machines! 
    
The idea of Moral Machines is based on the Trolley Dilemma, a fictional scenario presenting a decision-maker with a moral dilemma: choosing 'the lesser of two evils'. The scenario entails an autonomous car whose brakes fail at a pedestrian crossing. As it is too late to relinquish control to the car's passengers, the car needs to make a decision. Now.

The answers are not straightforward. There are a number of variables at play, which influence how people may feel about the decision: the number of pedestrians or passengers, whether the pedestrians are crossing the street legally, and personal characteristics that our autonomous car can somehow infer (people's bodytype, profession, gender, age, etc.). This program is a thought experiment, which explores how decisions should be made by auditing algorithms and collecting user feedback. You, the user of this program, will be put into (im)possible situations, left to decide about life and death.
